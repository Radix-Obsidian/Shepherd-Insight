Perfect — we’ll go in the exact order you chose:
**B → C → A**
and build this like a real Golden Sheep product spec.

# 🟦 **B — Shepherd Insight: Product Architecture Diagram (Text Version)**

**Phase 1 – App Dev • Phase 2 – Agent Systems • Phase 5 – Product Narrative**

This is the *system-level architecture* of Shepherd Insight with the Jobs-style pivot:
**One Engine → Three Tools → One Founder Journey.**

---

# **SHEPHERD INSIGHT — HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

Below is the **text blueprint** you can hand to engineers, designers, or AI agents.

---

# **1. Shepherd Engine (Core Intelligence Layer)**

### **Invisible to user — powers all three tools.**

**Responsibilities:**

* Problem analysis
* JTBD extraction
* Persona synthesis
* Competitor clustering
* Pain point classification
* Evidence weighting
* Market signal parsing
* Feature-value mapping
* MVP scope scoring
* Narrative generation
* AI reasoning orchestration

**Modules inside the Engine:**

1. **Insight Reasoner** – multi-step chain-of-thought evaluator
2. **Persona Synthesizer** – user profile + emotional journey builder
3. **Opportunity Evaluator** – scoring unmet needs
4. **Feature Mapper** – maps features → pains → value
5. **MVP Prioritizer** – calculates scope, effort, complexity
6. **Narrative Composer** – story, pitch, positioning generator
7. **Research Agent** – Firecrawl, web search, Groq-powered summaries

The founder never “sees” these.
This layer makes Shepherd magical.

* refined target user
* JTBD map
* opportunity gap
* top 3 value hypotheses

**Engine modules used:**
Insight Reasoner, Opportunity Evaluator, Persona Synthesizer

---

## **B. Shepherd Research Muse**

### *Purpose: Understand the user and problem deeply*

**Inputs:**

* user interviews
* screenshots
* notes
* competitor links
* audience surveys

**Outputs:**

* user personas
* emotional journey
* pain map
* pattern clustering
* competitor gap table

**Engine modules used:**
Research Agent, Persona Synthesizer, Opportunity Evaluator

---

## **C. Shepherd Blueprint**

### *Purpose: Turn clarity + research into an actual MVP plan*

**Inputs:**

* outputs from Compass + Muse
* founder priorities

**Outputs:**

* MVP scope
* feature list
* phased roadmap
* UI skeleton map
* pitch-ready narrative
* dev handoff (user stories, acceptance criteria)

**Engine modules used:**
Feature Mapper, MVP Prioritizer, Narrative Composer

---

# **3. The End-to-End Founder Journey**

### Step 1 — Founder enters raw idea → Compass

**They leave with clarity.**

### Step 2 — They bring inputs, interviews, notes → Muse

**They leave with understanding.**

### Step 3 — They push “Generate Blueprint” → Blueprint

**They leave with a real MVP plan.**

This is clean, emotional, simple — exactly the Steve Jobs way.
