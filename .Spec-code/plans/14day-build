# 🟧 **C — Shepherd Insight MVP Build Plan (14 Days)**

**Phase 1 – App Development • Phase 2 – Agent Building • Phase 3 – Production Readiness**

This is the **leanest, clearest, no-bullshit** plan to ship the *new, Steve-Jobs-aligned MVP* built around:

1. **Shepherd Compass**
2. **Shepherd Research Muse**
3. **Shepherd Blueprint**
4. **The Shepherd Engine (unified AI core)**

This plan fits perfectly with your stack:
**Next.js 14 • Supabase • Groq • Firecrawl • Vercel**

Let’s build like a real startup shipping under pressure.

# 🚀 **14-Day MVP Build Plan**

> **Goal:** Deliver a fully working, end-to-end MVP founders can use to turn an idea → blueprint.

Everything below is realistic, scoped, and shippable by a *solo founder using Cursor + AI agents*.
No fantasy. No corporate BS. Just execution.

---

# 🔥 **WEEK 1 — Build the Engine + Compass (Clarity)**

---

## **Day 1 — Architecture Setup**

* Create `apps/engine` folder inside repo

* Define modules:

  * `insight-reasoner.ts`
  * `persona-synth.ts`
  * `opportunity-score.ts`
  * `feature-mapper.ts`
  * `mvp-prioritizer.ts`
  * `story-composer.ts`

* Central orchestrator:
  `engine/index.ts`

* Add unified type system in `/types/engine.ts`

**Output:** The “Shepherd Engine” skeleton exists.

---

## **Day 2 — Build Insight Reasoner**

* Takes raw idea input
* Clarifies: problem → user → JTBD
* Uses Groq / Llama for speed + cost savings
* Add test prompts for consistency
* Add caching in Supabase (`engine_cache` table)

**Output:** Engine can convert an idea → structured clarity.

---

## **Day 3 — Build Shepherd Compass UI**

* `/compass` route
* Clean Steve-Jobs layout (big input, simple flow)
* Add “Your Clarity Map” panel
* Integrate engine → Next.js API route
* Store “Compass sessions” per user in Supabase

**Output:** Compass is fully functional end-to-end.

---

## **Day 4 — Persona Synthesizer Module**

* Takes interviews, notes, competitor links
* Outputs persona + emotional journey + pain map
* Firecrawl integration (competitor data ingestion)
* Add “insight compression” logic for noisy inputs

**Output:** Engine can generate personas from messy data.

---

## **Day 5 — Build Research Muse UI**

* `/muse` route
* Upload textarea, interview importer, competitor links
* Show persona, pain clusters, insight list
* Store results in Supabase `research_insights` table

**Output:** Muse works fully with real data.

---

## **Day 6 — Opportunity Scoring + Feature Mapper**

* Score user pains (frequency × intensity × unmet need)
* Map potential features to real pains
* Add simple *“effort score”* for dev complexity
* This becomes the MVP prioritizer’s foundation

**Output:** Engine can evaluate which features matter.

---

## **Day 7 — Internal QA / Fixing**

* Run 10–15 mock ideas end-to-end
* Ensure the journey Compass → Muse feels natural
* Remove friction, simplify flows
* Add loading states + UX polish (Jobs mindset)

**Output:** Week 1 complete — Engine + 2 tools working.

---

# ⚡️ **WEEK 2 — Build Blueprint (MVP Plan) + Polish**

---

## **Day 8 — MVP Prioritizer Module**

* Takes feature-pain map
* Scores every feature
* Selects **“Top 5 MVP essentials”**
* Generates phases: Core → Nice-to-have → Backlog

**Output:** Engine can decide MVP scope automatically.

---

## **Day 9 — Story Composer (Narrative Engine)**

This is where your product becomes **premium**.

Generates:

* problem narrative
* user story
* product value story
* pitch-ready explanation
* simple “How it works” outline
* 1-minute investor script

**Output:** Blueprint will generate investor-level clarity.

---

## **Day 10 — Build Shepherd Blueprint UI**

* `/blueprint` route

* A clean layout with sections:

  1. MVP Scope
  2. Features
  3. Roadmap
  4. Narrative
  5. Dev handoff

* Add “Export as PDF / Notion”

* Store outputs in Supabase `blueprints`

**Output:** Blueprint UI is working end-to-end.

---

## **Day 11 — Connect All Three Tools**

Create a unified navigation flow:

1. Compass → “Continue to Research Muse”
2. Muse → “Continue to Blueprint”
3. Blueprint → Export

Add a sidebar showing steps:

* Idea
* Research
* Blueprint

**Output:** The MVP has a complete funnel.

---

## **Day 12 — Performance + Stability**

* Add rate limits
* Add Supabase RLS rules
* Add basic analytics (“completion rates”)
* Add loading skeletons (Apple-like smoothness)

**Output:** MVP is production-ready.

---

## **Day 13 — Demo Mode + Seed Content**

* Add 3 demo projects:

  * “Marketplace Idea”
  * “AI Tool Idea”
  * “Fitness App Idea”

Shows new users what’s possible instantly.

**Output:** Demo mode increases conversions.

---

## **Day 14 — Final QA + Ship to Vercel**

* Full regression test
* Firecrawl tests
* Authentication flow
* Export flows
* Dark mode (optional but nice)
* Push to main → Production build

**Output:** MVP launched.

---

# 🐐 **Founder Takeaways**

* This is the cleanest, fastest path to shipping a fundable MVP.
* The MVP is opinionated, simple, emotional — Jobs philosophy.
* You’ll have a *cohesive product*, not a random tool collection.
* You’ll be ready for early users, YC, pre-seed, and social launch.
