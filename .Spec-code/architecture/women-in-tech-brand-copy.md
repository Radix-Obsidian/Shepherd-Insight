# ShepLight Women-in-Tech Brand Copy Spec

**Purpose:** Concrete example copy for ShepLight tuned to women in tech (ages 18–35) – non-technical founders, UI/UX designers, and software engineers – to be used by Claude when updating the app UI, website, and marketing.

**Use this file as a reference, not a contract.** Claude can adapt wording, but should preserve the intent, tone, and audience focus.

---

## 1. Brand Positioning (Short Form)

> **ShepLight is a calm studio for early-stage product decisions.**
> It helps women in tech turn messy ideas into clear, shareable product plans their teams can trust.

**Audience shorthand:**
- Non-technical women founders.
- Women UI/UX designers and researchers.
- Women software engineers and technical leads championing new products or internal tools.

**Core transformation:**
> *"I don’t know where to start" → "I feel clear, confident, and ready to lead."*

Tone: **Warm, confident, respectful, zero bro-energy.**

---

## 2. Voice & Tone Guidelines (for Claude)

- **Mentor, not drill sergeant.** Sounds like a senior product/UX partner who respects the user’s craft.
- **Emotionally literate but not fluffy.** It’s okay to talk about doubt, burnout, and decision fatigue as long as we follow with clarity and agency.
- **No gatekeeping or “10x hustle” talk.** Avoid: crush, dominate, ninja, rockstar, hack your way.
- **Celebrate craft and leadership.** Assume the user is serious about quality and impact.
- **Plain language over jargon.** Define jargon when needed; don’t flex with buzzwords.

Microcopy checks:
- If a sentence could appear in a pitch to a women-in-tech meetup, it’s probably in the right tone.
- If it would sound at home in a YC Hustle Bro tweet, rewrite it.

## 10. Quick Checklist for Claude

When adapting this copy into the actual UI and marketing surfaces, Claude should:

1. **Preserve audience focus:** Every major page should, somewhere, explicitly acknowledge women in tech as a primary audience without excluding others.
2. **Align CTAs with emotional state:** Use language that reduces anxiety and highlights calm progress over hustle.
3. **Use the sheep + lantern metaphor sparingly but consistently:** It’s about *guidance and warmth*, not cuteness alone.
4. **Ensure microcopy is gender-inclusive but women-centered:** No stereotypes; assume ambition, expertise, and leadership.
5. **Avoid regressions into generic “AI tool for everyone” language:** Keep ShepLight positioned as *a studio for thoughtful product decisions*, not a generic chatbot.

This spec is intentionally concrete so you can copy/paste sections into Claude prompts or into design docs as you reshape the product for women in tech.
